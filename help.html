      <h1> You can do SOOO much more that you think to help the coral reefs! </h2>
      <h3> Every little thing that you do can help. But just incase you can't think of any, here are a few ideas </h>
    </nav>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li> Drive Less </li>
          <p> Many people think that driving should not affect the coral reefs, but it does! When you drive, you are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, and making the world warmer. As the world gets warmer, so do the oceans. As the oceans get warmer, the coral reefs start to die. Instead of driving, take public transportation!  </p>
        <li> Reduce, Reuse and Recycle </li>
          <p> Most of the trach that you throw out just ends up in the ocean. When trash is thrown inot the ocean, many animals such as turtles, eat the trash and get sick. Also, the trash will get stuck on the coral reef and polute it. By doing the 3 R's, you are helping the coral reefs thrive </p>
        <li> Use Less Water </li>
          <p> If you use less water, less dirty runoff water will make its way to the ocean. </p>
        <li> Just Plant a Tree </p>
          <p> Helping the coral reefs can be as simple as planting a tree. When you plant a tree, you help stop the dirty water filled with chemicals from getting to the oceans. Trees also help reverse global warming. </p>
