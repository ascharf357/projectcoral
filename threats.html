      <h2> The coral reefs are dying off fast for many diffrent reasons, but one main reason...</h2>
    </nav>
    <nav>
      <h1> CLIMATE CHANGE </h1>
        <p class = "border"> As the climate gets warmer, so do the oceans. Warmer oceans mean that the coral will die. When the water gets warmer coral dislodges the algae resting in their tissue. This causes the coral to turn white. This is known as coral bleaching. You might think that the coral is now dead, but it is not. Corals can survive coral bleaching, but it is hard for them because they are under more stress. </p>
        <p class = "border" > Climate change also causes the icebergs in the poles to melt leaving more water in the oceans. This will cause sea levels to rise and coral to die </p>
      <h1> However, climate change is not the only threat to the coral reefs. Other major threats are... </h1>
         <h3> Overfishing </h3>

            <p class = "border"> Another factor that deeply affects the coral reefs is over fishing in coral areas. Overfishing can cause many endangered species to go extinct which could have a direct impact on the coral reefs. Furthermore, some fishing tools can cause harm to the coral reefs and animals themselves. For example, turtles can get trapped in netting used for fishing. This causes the turtles and other endangered animals to dies. The netting can also harm the coral itself!  <p>

        <h3> Trash being dumped into the oceans </h3>
          <p class = "border"> Many animals such as turtles and birds eat plastic products that made their way to the ocean thinking that they are food. However, it is not good for the animal's stomach to eat plastic and this can sometimes result in their death. So if you see trash on the beach or even on the street, by picking it up, you could be saving a turtle's life. </p>
