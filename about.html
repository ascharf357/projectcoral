      <h3> What is a coral reef? </h2>
        <p> A coral reefs is a collection of many differnt marine organisims that all live together in warmer waters. These reefs house many different species of fish, crustations, plants and much more. Coral is made of small layer of calcium carbonate. 
      
      <h3> What are the different typs of coral reefs? </h3>
        <p> There are three main types of coral reefs. 
          <ol>
            <li> Fringing </li>
              <p> The fringing reef is the most common of the coral reefs. Fringe reefs grow towards the sea directly from the shore. They also form a ring around the shore and surronding islands. 
            <li> Barrier </li>
              <p> Barrier reefs, like fringing reefs, also form a ring around the shore line. However, unlike fringing reefs which grow along the shore, barrier reefs are separated from the shore by water.
            <li> Atoll </li>
              <p> Atoll reefs are circular with a lagoon in the middle. These reefs are formed when a fringing grows up from a sunkan volcanic island. 
          </ol>

      <h3> What is coral? </h3>
        <p> You might think that coral is a plant, but it is not! Coral is actually an animal. The way the coral gets it food is by reaching out with its tentacle arms to capture the food from the water. </p>
